## What is Joomla?

Joomla is a powerful content management system (CMS) built using open-source software, which empowers users to create dynamic and secure websites with ease. Since its launch in 2005, Joomla has evolved into one of the world's most widely used CMS platforms, with over 99 million downloads to date. The Joomla CMS shines with its user-friendly interface, an array of built-in features, and robust security.

Joomla's success stems from its flexibility and adaptability, allowing it to compete with other popular CMS platforms, such as WordPress and Drupal. What sets Joomla apart is its vibrant community of developers, designers, and users who offer support, resources, and a thriving ecosystem of templates and extensions.

## How Does Joomla Work?

Joomla harnesses the powers of the PHP programming language and MySQL databases. Built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, Joomla efficiently manages the flow of data and the presentation of content on a website. The MVC design allows for flexibility and easy customization, which is essential for both seasoned developers and tech-savvy beginners.

In this architectural framework, the model is responsible for handling data retrieval and updating the database. Meanwhile, the view produces the output and interacts with the model to obtain necessary information. Once the view generates the output, control returns to the Joomla framework, which then applies a template to produce the final web page.

## AVIF Support: The Future of Joomla

Joomla recognizes the ever-evolving landscape of web development and embraces emerging technologies like AVIF, a powerful image format promising superior compression efficiency. With anticipation for the release of PHP 8.1, which includes native support for AVIF, Joomla stands poised to integrate this cutting-edge format and further elevate its reputation as a scalable and innovative CMS.

## Joomla Resources and Support

Diving into Joomla has never been easier. A wealth of resources, tutorials, forums, and documentation is available for beginners and experts alike. Leverage the experiences of successful organizations and businesses that use Joomla, and extract valuable insights to customize and optimize your website.

Whether you're new to Joomla or a seasoned developer, participation in the Joomla community proves indispensable. This global network of enthusiasts and professionals will propel your web development journey and unlock the full potential of your Joomla-powered website.

## The Verdict

With a rich history, an unwavering commitment to innovation, and an active community, Joomla emerges as a top contender in the realm of content management systems. Across industries and sectors, the benefits of Joomla continue to impress both developers and end-users. The CMS's user-friendly interface, flexible architecture, security features, and ever-growing library of templates and extensions combine to make Joomla an undeniable force in website creation and management.
