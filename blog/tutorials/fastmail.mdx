## Meet AVIF: The Image Format Revolution

AVIF, the new kid on the block, is an image format that inherits its roots from the AV1 standard. Developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), it's all set to challenge its rivals, namely JPEG and WebP. AVIF outshines its competition due to its superior compression efficiency, support for high dynamic range (HDR) images, and compatibility with groundbreaking features.

Just how impressive is AVIF? Imagine having a high-resolution, vibrant image with a file size that's 90% smaller than its JPEG or WebP counterparts. The enticing balance between quality and compression makes AVIF a potential game-changer, paving the way for faster web performance and seamless compatibility across platforms.

## Fastmail: The Security-Focused Email Service

Fastmail doesn't need flashy billboards or catchy slogans â€” it speaks for itself. As a security-centric email service provider, Fastmail ensures protection through robust encryption and resilient data storage. Free from the clutter of advertisements, Fastmail delivers a seamless user experience that values privacy above all else.

Now you must be wondering, how is this Aussie-based email service (with servers in New York and Amsterdam) relevant to AVIF? Well, that's an excellent question, and we promise the answer won't disappoint.

## The AVIF-Fastmail Connection

Unfortunately, the two haven't fully shaken hands just yet. While Fastmail might be secure and privacy-focused, it doesn't support inline viewing or sending of AVIF images. But don't frown yet, because you can still attach AVIF images as files to your emails, akin to any other file type. For now, it's a workaround that allows you to share beautiful, high-quality images in a compact format.

## Unlocking AVIF's Potential

AVIF's potential is undeniable, and it's only a matter of time before it's widely embraced. In the meantime, don't let the lack of inline AVIF support bog you down. Keep experimenting with this revolutionary image format and find creative ways to share it with your friends and colleagues.

As for Fastmail, we know they're always working to stay ahead of the curve. So, who knows? Maybe soon, Fastmail customers will experience full AVIF integration, meeting at the crossroads of secure communication and cutting-edge image technology. And when that day comes, you can count on us to keep you informed.
