AOMedia has some of the biggest names in tech on board, including Netflix, Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Their mission is to develop open, royalty-free technologies so that nobody has to pay for using their innovative solutions. This positions AVIF as a strong contender against traditional formats like JPG, PNG, and even Google's WebP.
