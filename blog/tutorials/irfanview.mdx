## Discovering AVIF: The Future of Image Formats

Imagine a world where images are not only of higher quality but also significantly smaller in file size. That's the vision brought to life by AVIF (AV1 Image Format), a groundbreaking open-source, royalty-free image format that promises to revolutionize the way we store and transmit images. Developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), in collaboration with tech giants such as Google, Cisco, and Xiph.org, AVIF is built upon the keyframes of the cutting-edge AV1 video format. With companies like Netflix already noticing its superior image quality and reduced file size compared to traditional formats like JPEG, PNG, and WebP, AVIF is poised to reshape the landscape of digital imagery.
