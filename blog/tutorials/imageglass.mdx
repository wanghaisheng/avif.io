## The Evolution of Image Formats: AVIF

In the ever-evolving digital world, we're constantly trying to find ways to improve the quality of images while reducing their file size. Enter AVIF, the cutting-edge image file format developed by the Alliance for Open Media, a consortium of powerhouse technology companies like Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Netflix. AVIF revolutionizes the world of image compression by using the AV1 codec, which can store high-quality images in files the same size as lower-quality JPEGs but with fewer distortions and artifacts. It supports a wide range of color depths, HDR and monochrome imaging, and both lossless and lossy compression, positioning itself as a strong contender against JPEG, PNG, and WEBP formats.
