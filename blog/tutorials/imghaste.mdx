## Introducing AVIF: A Modern Leap in Image Compression

Imagine the internet as a busy city, where images are the cars that congest its streets. Reducing these files' sizes means less traffic, and consequently, faster websites. Enter AVIFâ€”an image format for the internet of the future.

The AV1 Image Format (AVIF) is an exceptional, royalty-free, and open-source image format that is revolutionizing the world of digital imagery. Built on the foundations of AV1 video format, AVIF squeezes every ounce of image quality without bloating your bandwidth. Thanks to the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), Google, Cisco, and Xiph.org, AVIF delivers stunning visuals while keeping file sizes incredibly low. It's like turning our congested city streets into smooth, efficient highways.

Replacing the decades-old JPEG and maintaining an edge over more recent formats such as WebP, AVIF is winning the hearts of major players like Netflix and gaining traction across the web.
