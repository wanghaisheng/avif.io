## A Revolution in Image Formats: The Birth of AVIF

Imagine a world where high-quality images load instantly on every device and dazzle our eyes, without weighing down our internet connections. This dream is not far from reality, thanks to the arrival of the AV1 Image Format (AVIF), a game-changing innovation born from the relentless pursuit of excellence in image and video compression technology.

AVIF, with its impressive compression ratio and broad feature support, steals the limelight from its predecessors, including popular formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF. Unshackling the online world from the limitations of these older formats, the mastermind behind AVIF—the Alliance for Open Media (AOM)—has encapsulated more than three decades of research into this powerful image format, connected to the AV1 open-source video compression standard.
