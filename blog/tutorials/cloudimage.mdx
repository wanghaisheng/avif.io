## The Emergence of AVIF

The digital world is evolving, and the demand for efficient, high-quality image formats has spurred the development of AVIF (AV1 Image File Format). This next-generation image format has emerged alongside strengthened support from major players in the tech industry. The AV1 and AVIF formats are open-source, empowering the whole community to benefit from their advantages.

AVIF delivers exceptional image quality (particularly for HDR images with greater color depths than 8 bits) and boasts a multitude of functions. Its space-saving design enables it to reduce image size by an impressive 50% compared to JPEG, outperforming its rival format, WebP. This enhanced compression supports video-on-demand and cloud providers in minimizing data streams, enabling them to slash website loading times, preserve network bandwidth, and trim data traffic.

This revolutionary image format brings benefits to various industries beyond just the online world. Image archives, photographers, and printing industries, in particular, can reap the rewards of increased resolution coupled with reduced resource usage.
