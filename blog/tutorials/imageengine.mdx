## Introduction to AVIF

In the vast cosmos of image formats, AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) shines like a supernova. Born from the parentage of AV1 video codec, AVIF defies the gravity of data load by achieving an outstanding balance of image quality and file size. It transcends the limits of traditional image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF, and even outshines its closest rivals, such as the relatively new WebP.

Venturing into the unknown realms of next-generation image formats can be daunting for web developers. They face the burden of unraveling the mysteries of multiple formats, while grappling with the forces of quality, payload size, and code complexity. Fear not, for ImageEngine - a content delivery network with AVIF support - can pilot you through this interstellar abyss, delivering images at warp speed without sacrificing quality.
